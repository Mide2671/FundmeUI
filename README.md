# 🚀 FundMe dApp

A decentralized crowdfunding application built with **Solidity**, **React.js**, **Ethers.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This dApp allows users to fund an Ethereum smart contract and lets the contract owner withdraw accumulated funds. Built as part of my learning journey into Web3 and smart contracts.
